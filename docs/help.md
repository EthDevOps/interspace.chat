Welcome to interspace.chat, a virtual "hub" for online collaborative events combining video conferencing, textchat, livestreams, event schedule, and other features. Interspace.chat currently only supports laptop and desktop browsers, and some tablet devices. There is only limited mobile device support at this time.

**Browser requirements**

For the best experience, we suggest Chrome or Safari (Firefox not supported) with the following settings:
-access to your microphone and your camera for participation in jitsi videoconferencing.
-disable pop-up blockers and shields
-javascript enabled.

**Privacy**

Interspace does not track or log your usage. Please be advised however that using the calendar will provide Google with usage data.

**Feature Navigation**

Use either the graphic elements or the sitemap in the sidebar to select the features you want to use. The popup elements are draggable and fluidly resizable so you can arrange the interspace based on your screen resolution and visual preferences. 

**Portals**

The main feature of interspace.chat are embedded persistent jitsi videoconference "portals". 

There are three portals for ethTurin:

* Conference Room
* Mentor-Ring
* Covid-19

Check the Calendar for scheduled events in each portal.

Clicking on "livestream" or "text chat" button in the portal popup will open color coded popups for that portal. All popups for an individual portal can be used simultaneously in the interspace (that's the point!)

One cannot however use multiple portals simultaneously, nor can one use the livestream from one portal, and a videoconference from a second portal in the interspace at the same time. The textchat window will always open to the channel for the open portal, but one can use the menu in the textchat popup to navigate to channels for other portals.

- **Enter user name**

When joining a portal's videochat room, please click on your avatar and provide a user name so that moderators and other participants know who they're interacting with. If you only want to lurk, try the livestream instead :-)

If you would like to display a gravatar when your camera is off in addition to your user name, click on the "three vertical dots" icon in the lower right hand corner of the toolbar, which opens up a settings menu, allowing you to enter a gravatar linked email address. 

- **Microphone and Camera**

By default, all users microphones are muted on joining a portal conference room. Microphone and camera settings are available by clicking on the icons in the toolbar at the bottom of the screen.

- **Video quality / Bandwith issues**

Users always blame the videoconference client for poor experience, when it is usually their own connection speed, the capabilities of their hardware, or HAVING TOO MANY TABS AND /OR PROGRAMS OPEN which is responsible for poor quality, dropouts, lags, etc. 

If you are experiencing quality issues, click on the "three vertical dots" icon in the lower right hand corner of the jitsi toolbar, and reduce the video / audio quality settings.

Whether you are a speaker or a participant, we suggest shutting down all programs running in the background, and to have only the interspace tab open in your browser while participating in an event. You'll be surprised at the improvement in the quality of your experience when everything else is not consuming your processor speed, bandwidth, and browser cache. 

**Livestreams**
Livestreams for each portal can be viewed either in the resizable popup directly in interspace, or in an external tab. "View livestream" buttons in portal popups will open a livestream popup in the interspace. The "livestream" UI popup and the livestream link in the sidebar sitemap provide external links which will open in a new tab.
